Pseudocode for encrypt.C

listAll(eNode* firstelement)

While the value of first element is not null
    Print to screen the name of the first element
    Set the value of first element to the next element

shiftEncrypt(eNode* firstelement, int shiftAmt)

Create variable to represent the current unencrypted node and 
assign to it parameter firstelement
Create node which is the current encrypted node
While the current unencrypted node is not pointing to null
    Create a variable to hold an encrypted name
    For each character in the name of the current unencrypted node
        Shift a character of the unencrypted node's name by the shift amount
        Assign this shifted result to the encrypted name
    Copy the full encrypted name into the current encrypted node
    Move to next unencrypted node
    If the current unencrypted node is null, exit while loop
    Create node which is the new encrypted node
    Prepend new encrypted node to beginning of linked list of encrypted nodes
    Set current encrypted node to this new encrypted node
Set first encrypted node to current encrypted node
Clear unneeded node variables

shift(char name, int shiftAmt)

Create character to hold encrypted character
If parameter character is uppercase alpabetic
    If shifting the parameter character will go beyond alpabetic characters
        Encrypted character will be parameter offset by shift amount and 
        wrapped back around to alphabetic characters
    Else
        Encrypted character will be parameter offset by shift amount
Else if parameter character is lowercase alphabetic
    If shifting the parameter character will go beyond alpabetic characters
        Encrypted character will be parameter offset by shift amount and 
        wrapped back around to alphabetic characters
    Else
        Encrypted character will be parameter offset by shift amount
Else if not alphabetic character
    Do not offset parameter character
Return character
